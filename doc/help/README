This directory contains the help file for the rapidSTORM project
in Docbook format with a wrapper for the htmlhelp Docbook stylesheet.

To sort the index correctly, I modified the htmlhelp-common file in the
template for indexterms in hhk mode and in the calling template.
I enabled sorting the indexterm elements via xsl:sort and changed the
code to generate thesecondary  entries. The htmlhelp-common-diff.txt
file in this directory documents the changes.

To compile this project, the MS hhc compiler is necessary. On NT systems,
the itircl.dll and itss.dll files must be present and registered with 
regsvr32.dll . The hhc compiler will output a warning if this is not the
case.
