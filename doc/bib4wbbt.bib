	program that is now at version 1.31 and is used for many imaging
	applications, including those that that span the gamut from skin
	analysis to neuroscience. ImageJ is in the public domain and runs
	on any operating system (OS). ImageJ is easy to use and can do many
	imaging manipulations. A very large and knowledgeable group makes
	up the user community for ImageJ. Topics covered are imaging abilities;
	cross platform; image formats support as of June 2004; extensions,
	including macros and plug-ins; and imaging library. NIH reports tens
	of thousands of downloads at a rate of about 24,000 per month currently.
	ImageJ can read most of the widely used and significant formats used
	in biomedical images. Manipulations supported are read/write of image
	files and operations on separate pixels, image regions, entire images,
	and volumes (stacks in ImageJ). Basic operations supported include
	convolution, edge detection, Fourier transform, histogram and particle
	analyses, editing and color manipulation, and more advanced operations,
	as well as visualization. For assistance in using ImageJ, users e-mail
	each other, and the user base is highly knowledgeable and will answer
	requests on the mailing list. A thorough manual with many examples
	and illustrations has been written by Tony Collins of the Wright
	Cell Imaging Facility at Toronto Western Research Institute and is
	available, along with other listed resources, via the Web.},

	the position of individual molecules to obtain optical images with
	a lateral resolution better than 30 nm. Single molecule localisation
	microscopy was originally demonstrated only in two dimensions but
	has recently been extended to three dimensions. Here we develop a
	new approach to three-dimensional (3D) localisation microscopy by
	engineering of the point-spread function (PSF) of a fluorescence
	microscope. By introducing a linear phase gradient between the two
	halves of the objective pupil plane the PSF is split into two lateral
	lobes whose relative position depends on defocus. Calculations suggested
	that the phase gradient resulting from the very small tolerances
	in parallelism of conventional slides made from float glass would
	be sufficient to generate a two-lobed PSF. We demonstrate that insertion
	of a suitably chosen microscope slide that occupies half the objective
	aperture combined with a novel fast fitting algorithm for 3D localisation
	estimation allows nanoscopic imaging with detail resolution well
	below 100 nm in all three dimensions (standard deviations of 20,
	16, and 42 nm in x, y , and z directions, respectively). The utility
	of the approach is shown by imaging the complex 3D distribution of
	microtubules in cardiac muscle cells that were stained with conventional
	near infrared fluorochromes. The straightforward optical setup, minimal
	hardware requirements and large axial localisation range make this
	approach suitable for many nanoscopic imaging applications.},

	based visualization of point data that address some of these deficiencies.
	The new visualization methods are designed to suppress erroneous

  journal = j-biol-chem,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Key synaptic proteins from the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
	factor attachment protein receptor) family, among many others, are
	organized at the plasma membrane of cells as clusters containing
	dozens to hundreds of protein copies. However, the exact membranal
	distribution of proteins into clusters or as single molecules, the
	organization of molecules inside the clusters and the clustering
	mechanisms are unclear due to limitations of the imaging and analytical
	tools. Focusing on syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, we implemented direct
	stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) together with
	quantitative clustering algorithms to demonstrate a novel approach
	to explore the distribution of clustered and non-clustered molecules
	at the membrane of PC12 cells with single-molecule precision. dSTORM
	images reveal, for the first time, solitary syntaxin/SNAP-25 molecules
	and small clusters as well as larger clusters. The non-clustered
	syntaxin or SNAP-25 molecules are mostly concentrated in areas adjacent
	to their own clusters. In the clusters, the density of the molecules
	gradually decreases from the dense cluster core to the periphery.
	We further detected large clusters that contain several density gradients.
	This suggests that some of the clusters are formed by unification
	of several clusters that preserve their original organization or

	that can be cycled between fluorescent and dark states, and an "activator"
	that facilitates photo-activation of the reporter. Combinatorial
	pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes
	with many distinct colors. Iterative, color-specific activation of
	sparse subsets of these probes allows their localization with nanometer
	accuracy, enabling the construction of a super-resolution STORM image.
	Using this approach, we demonstrate multicolor imaging of DNA model
	samples and mammalian cells with 20- to 30-nanometer resolution.

  pages = {385--388},
  abstract = {When light illuminates a rough metallic surface, hotspots can appear,
	where the light is concentrated on the nanometre scale, producing
	an intense electromagnetic field. This phenomenon, called the surface
	enhancement effect, has a broad range of potential applications,
	such as the detection of weak chemical signals. Hotspots are believed
	to be associated with localized electromagnetic modes, caused by
	the randomness of the surface texture. Probing the electromagnetic
	field of the hotspots would offer much insight towards uncovering
	the mechanism generating the enhancement; however, it requires a
	spatial resolution of 1-2?nm, which has been a long-standing challenge
	in optics. The resolution of an optical microscope is limited to
	about half the wavelength of the incident light, approximately 200-300?nm.
	Although current state-of-the-art techniques, including near-field
	scanning optical microscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy, cathode
	luminescence imaging and two-photon photoemission imaging have subwavelength
	resolution, they either introduce a non-negligible amount of perturbation,
	complicating interpretation of the data, or operate only in a vacuum.
	As a result, after more than 30 years since the discovery of the
	surface enhancement effect, how the local field is distributed remains
	unknown. Here we present a technique that uses Brownian motion of
	single molecules to probe the local field. It enables two-dimensional
	imaging of the fluorescence enhancement profile of single hotspots
	on the surfaces of aluminium thin films and silver nanoparticle clusters,
	with accuracy down to 1.2?nm. Strong fluorescence enhancements, up
	to 54 and 136 times respectively, are observed in those two systems.
	This strong enhancement indicates that the local field, which decays
	exponentially from the peak of a hotspot, dominates the fluorescence
	enhancement profile.},

  abstract = {Single particle tracking has seen numerous applications in biophysics,
	ranging from the diffusion of proteins in cell membranes to the movement
	of molecular motors. A plethora of computer algorithms have been
	developed to monitor the sub-pixel displacement of fluorescent objects
	between successive video frames, and some have been claimed to have
	"nanometer" resolution. To date, there has been no rigorous comparison
	of these algorithms under realistic conditions. In this paper, we
	quantitatively compare specific implementations of four commonly
	used tracking algorithms: cross-correlation, sum-absolute difference,
	centroid, and direct Gaussian fit. Images of fluorescent objects
	ranging in size from point sources to 5 {micro}m were computer generated
	with known sub-pixel displacements. Realistic noise was added and
	the above four algorithms were compared for accuracy and precision.
	We found that cross-correlation is the most accurate algorithm for
	large particles. However, for point sources, direct Gaussian fit
	to the intensity distribution is the superior algorithm in terms
	of both accuracy and precision, and is the most robust at low signal-to-noise.
	Most significantly, all four algorithms fail as the signal-to-noise
	ratio approaches 4. We judge direct Gaussian fit to be the best algorithm
	when tracking single fluorophores, where the signal-to-noise is frequently
	near 4.},

	plasmonic properties of Au nanocrystals. The second is the plasmonic?molecular
	resonance coupling, where molecules exhibit strong light absorption
	around the plasmon resonance energies. The strong resonance coupling
	gives hybridized states and anti-crossing behaviors. The third occurs
	when molecules possess both absorption and ?uorescence emission around

	In this study, we have determined the mechanism of photoswitching

	(SPIM)\] performs very well at low numerical apertures. It complements
	conventional (FM), confocal (CFM), and two-photon fluorescence microscopy
	(2h$\nu$-FM) currently used in modern life sciences. Lateral and
	axial SPIM point spread function (PSF) extents are measured by using
	fluorescent beads to determine the 3D resolution. The results are
	compared with values derived from an analytical theory and numerical
	simulations. The discrepancies are found to be less than 5\%. The
	axial extent of a SPIM-PSF (10{\texttimes}/0.3 W) is approximately
	5.7 $\mu$m. This value is almost a factor of 2 smaller than in CFM,
	more than 2.5 times smaller than in FM, and more than three times
	smaller than in 2h$\nu$-FM. SPIM outperforms 2h$\nu$-FM and FM, while
	CFM has a better axial resolution at NAs above 0.8.},

	of varied elasticity. Subsequent fusion into myotubes occurs independent
	of substrate flexibility. However, myosin/actin striations emerge
	later only on gels with stiffness typical of normal muscle (passive
	Young's modulus, E ~12 kPa). On glass and much softer or stiffer
	gels, including gels emulating stiff dystrophic muscle, cells do
	not striate. In addition, myotubes grown on top of a compliant bottom
	layer of glass-attached myotubes (but not softer fibroblasts) will
	striate, whereas the bottom cells will only assemble stress fibers
	and vinculin-rich adhesions. Unlike sarcomere formation, adhesion
	strength increases monotonically versus substrate stiffness with
	strongest adhesion on glass. These findings have major implications

	Tm of thermally induced denaturation of STV and AVD in phosphate
	buffer from 75 and 83?C to 112 and 117?C at full biotin saturation,
	respectively. This thermostability is the highest reported for proteins
	coming from either mesophilic or thermophilic organisms. In both
	proteins, biotin also increases the calorimetric enthalpy and the
	cooperativity of the unfolding. Thermalstability of STV was also
	evaluated in the presence of high concentrations of urea or guanidinium
	hydrochloride (GuHCl). In 6 M GuHCl, STV remains as a tetramer and
	the Tm of the STV-biotin complex is centered at 108?C, a few degrees
	below the value obtained in phosphate buffer. On the contrary, STV
	under fully saturating condition remains mainly in its dimeric form
	in 8 M urea and the thermogram shows two endotherms. The main endotherm
	at a lower temperature has been ascribed to the dimeric liganded

  abstract = {The effect of biotin binding on the thermal stability of streptavidin
	(STV) and avidin (AVD) was evaluated using differential scanning
	calorimetry. Biotin binding increases the midpoint of temperature
	Tm of thermally induced denaturation of STV and AVD in phosphate
	buffer from 75 and 83 degrees C to 112 and 117 degrees C at full
	biotin saturation, respectively. This thermostability is the highest
	reported for proteins coming from either mesophilic or thermophilic
	organisms. In both proteins, biotin also increases the calorimetric
	enthalpy and the cooperativity of the unfolding. Thermal stability
	of STV was also evaluated in the presence of high concentrations
	of urea or guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl). In 6 M GuHCl, STV remains
	as a tetramer and the Tm of the STV-biotin complex is centered at
	108 degrees C, a few degrees below the value obtained in phosphate
	buffer. On the contrary, STV under fully saturating condition remains
	mainly in its dimeric form in 8 M urea and the thermogram shows two
	endotherms. The main endotherm at a lower temperature has been ascribed
	to the dimeric liganded state with a Tm of 87 degrees C, and the
	higher temperature endotherm to the tetrameric liganded form with
	a Tm of 106 degrees C. As the thermostability of unliganded protein

	dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used as efficient
	reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state

	upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching
	and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous solution irradiating first
	at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration
	of absorption and fluorescence strongly depends on efficient oxygen
	removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine.
	Single-molecule fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized
	Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
	alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and
	nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability of >90\%
	at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine
	dyes volunteer as a simple alternative for ultrahigh-density optical

  abstract = {Biological structures span many orders of magnitude in size, but far-field
	visible light microscopy suffers from limited resolution. A new method
	for fluorescence imaging has been developed that can obtain spatial
	distributions of large numbers of fluorescent molecules on length
	scales shorter than the classical diffraction limit. Fluorescence
	photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) analyzes thousands
	of single fluorophores per acquisition, localizing small numbers
	of them at a time, at low excitation intensity. To control the number
	of visible fluorophores in the field of view and ensure that optically
	active molecules are separated by much more than the width of the
	point spread function, photoactivatable fluorescent molecules are
	used, in this case the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein
	(PA-GFP). For these photoactivatable molecules, the activation rate
	is controlled by the activation illumination intensity; nonfluorescent
	inactive molecules are activated by a high-frequency (405-nm) laser
	and are then fluorescent when excited at a lower frequency. The fluorescence
	is imaged by a CCD camera, and then the molecules are either reversibly
	inactivated or irreversibly photobleached to remove them from the
	field of view. The rate of photobleaching is controlled by the intensity
	of the laser used to excite the fluorescence, in this case an Ar+
	ion laser. Because only a small number of molecules are visible at
	a given time, their positions can be determined precisely; with only
	[\~{}]100 detected photons per molecule, the localization precision
	can be as much as 10-fold better than the resolution, depending on
	background levels. Heterogeneities on length scales of the order
	of tens of nanometers are observed by FPALM of PA-GFP on glass. FPALM
	images are compared with images of the same molecules by widefield
	fluorescence. FPALM images of PA-GFP on a terraced sapphire crystal
	surface were compared with atomic force microscopy and show that
	the full width at half-maximum of features [\~{}]86 {+/-} 4 nm is
	significantly better than the expected diffraction-limited optical
	resolution. The number of fluorescent molecules and their brightness
	distribution have also been determined using FPALM. This new method
	suggests a means to address a significant number of biological questions
	that had previously been limited by microscope resolution. 10.1529/biophysj.106.091116},

  abstract = {Monolayer-protected gold clusters (Au MPCs) are stable, easily synthesized,
	organic solvent-soluble, nanoscale materials. MPCs with protecting
	monolayers composed of alkanethiolate ligands (RS) can be functionalized
	(R?S) by ligand place-exchange reactions, i.e., x(R?SH) + (RS)mMPC
	? x(RSH) + (R?S)m(RS)m-xMPC, where x is the number of ligands place-exchanged
	(1 to 108) and m is the original number (ca. 108) of alkanethiolate
	ligands per Au314 cluster. The dynamics and mechanism of this reaction
	were probed by determining its kinetic order and final equilibrium
	position relative to incoming (R?S) and initial (RS) protecting thiolate
	ligands. The reactions were characterized by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopy,
	and the dispersity of place-exchange reaction products was preliminarily
	inspected by chromatography. The results of these experiments show
	that ligand exchange is an associative reaction and that the displaced
	thiolate becomes a thiol solution product. Disulfides and oxidized
	sulfur species are not involved in the reaction. Cluster-bound thiolate
	ligands differ widely in susceptibility to place-exchange, presumably
	owing to differences in binding sites (Au core edge and vertice sites
	are presumably more reactive than terrace sites). The rate of place-exchange
	decreases as the chain length and/or steric bulk of the initial protecting
	ligand shell is increased. The exchange results and proposed mechanism
	are compared to those for place-exchange reactions on self-assembled
	monolayers confined to flat gold surfaces. },

	tissue culture have been studied in phase contrast illumination,

	and spindle changes have thereby been obtained simultaneously.2.
	Chromosome separation in the chick is made up of two components--a
	movement of chromosomes towards the spindle poles, and an elongation
	of the spindle as a whole.3. The assumption is made that the force
	acting on a chromosome is directly proportional to the velocity with
	which the chromosome moves. If this assumption is accepted as an
	approximation, it is possible to interpret the relationship of chromosome
	velocity to chromosome separation and spindle-fibre length. This
	leads to the conclusion that anaphase movement is due, not to repulsion
	between chromosomes, but to a contractile mechanism operating from
	the spindle poles.4. Polarized light studies indicate that the orientation
	of the spindle material is high at the poles, and weaker at the equator.
	There is a small aster at either end of the spindle.5. The centrosomes
	are interpreted as centres of an orienting force, which build up
	the contractile mechanism of the spindle from isotropic protoplasm.
	It is suggested that asters may also be contractile, and cause elongation
	of the spindle.6. The inadequacy of the old conception of spindle
	fibres is discussed in the light of more modern views on molecular

  abstract = {Localization of single molecules in microscopy images is a key step
	in quantitative single particle data analysis. Among them, single
	molecule based super-resolution optical microscopy techniques require
	high localization accuracy as well as computation of large data sets
	in the order of 105 single molecule detections to reconstruct a single
	image. We hereby present an algorithm based on image wavelet segmentation
	and single particle centroid determination, and compare its performance
	with the commonly used Gaussian fitting of the point spread function.
	We performed realistic simulations at different signal-to-noise ratios
	and particle densities and show that the calculation time using the
	wavelet approach can be more than one order of magnitude faster than
	that of Gaussian fitting without a significant degradation of the
	localization accuracy, from 1 nm to 4 nm in our range of study. We
	propose a simulation-based estimate of the resolution of an experimental
	single molecule acquisition.},

  abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton of dendritic spines plays a key role in morphological
	aspects of synaptic plasticity. The detailed analysis of the spine
	structure and dynamics in live neurons, however, has been hampered
	by the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional fluorescence
	microscopy. The advent of nanoscopic imaging techniques thus holds
	great promise for the study of these processes. We implemented a
	strategy for the visualization of morphological changes of dendritic
	spines over tens of minutes at a lateral resolution of 25 to 65 nm.
	We have generated a low-affinity photoconvertible probe, capable
	of reversibly binding to actin and thus allowing long-term photoactivated
	localization microscopy of the spine cytoskeleton. Using this approach,
	we resolve structural parameters of spines and record their long-term
	dynamics at a temporal resolution below one minute. Furthermore,
	we have determined changes in the spine morphology in response to
	pharmacologically induced synaptic activity and quantified the actin
	redistribution underlying these changes. By combining PALM imaging
	with quantum dot tracking, we could also simultaneously visualize
	the cytoskeleton and the spine membrane, allowing us to record complementary
	information on the morphological changes of the spines at super-resolution.},

	deprived of growth factors undergo morphological differentiation
	with tube formation after 6-12 wk, and that human dermal microvascular
	endothelial cells differentiate after 1 wk of growth factor deprivation.
	Here, we report that morphological differentiation of both types
	of endothelial cells is markedly accelerated by culture on a reconstituted
	gel composed of basement membrane proteins. Under these conditions,
	tube formation begins in 1-2 h and is complete by 24 h. The tubes
	are maintained for greater than 2 wk. Little or no proliferation
	occurs under these conditions, although the cells, when trypsinized
	and replated on fibronectin-coated tissue culture dishes, resume
	division. Ultrastructurally, the tubes possess a lumen surrounded
	by endothelial cells attached to one another by junctional complexes.
	The cells possess Weibel-Palade bodies and factor VIII-related antigens,
	and take up acetylated low density lipoproteins. Tubule formation
	does not occur on tissue culture plastic coated with laminin or collagen
	IV, either alone or in combination, or on an agarose or a collagen
	I gel. However, endothelial cells cultured on a collagen I gel supplemented
	with laminin form tubules, while supplementation with collagen IV
	induces a lesser degree of tubule formation. Preincubation of endothelial
	cells with antibodies to laminin prevented tubule formation while
	antibodies to collagen IV were less inhibitory. Preincubation of
	endothelial cells with synthetic peptides derived from the laminin
	B1 chain that bind to the laminin cell surface receptor or incorporation
	of these peptides into the gel matrix blocked tubule formation, whereas
	control peptides did not. These observations indicate that endothelial
	cells can rapidly differentiate on a basement membrane-like matrix

  abstract = {Background informationSingle molecule-based super-resolution methods
	have become important tools to study nanoscale structures in cell
	biology. However, the complexity of multi-colour applications has
	prevented them from being widely used amongst biologists. Direct
	stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) offers a simple
	way to perform single molecule super-resolution imaging without the
	need for an activator fluorophore and compatible with many conventionally
	used fluorophores. The search for the ideal dye pairs suitable for
	dual-colour dSTORM has been compromised by the fact that fluorophores
	spectrally apt for dual-colour imaging differ with respect to the
	optimal buffer conditions required for photoswitching and the generation
	of prolonged non-fluorescent (OFF) states.ResultsWe present a novel
	variant of dSTORM that combines advantages of spectral demixing with
	the buffer compatible blinking properties of red emitting carbocyanine
	dyes, spectral demixing dSTORM (SD-dSTORM). In contrast to previously
	published work, SD-dSTORM requires reduced laser power and fewer
	imaging frames for the faithful reconstruction of super-resolved
	biological nanostructures. In addition, SD-dSTORM allows the use
	of commercially available rather than custom-made probes and does
	not rely on potentially error-prone cross-talk correction, thus allowing
	reliable co-localisation.ConclusionsSD-dSTORM presents a significant
	advance towards user-friendly single molecule localisation-based
	super-resolution microscopy combining advantages of state-of-the-art

	with a precision several times greater than the resolution limit
	of the microscope. We show that the intermittent fluorescence or
	'blinking' of quantum dots can analyzed by an Independent Component
	Analysis so as to identify the light emitted by each individual nanoparticle,
	localize it precisely, and thereby resolve groups of closely spaced
	(< lambda / 30) quantum dots. Both simulated and experimental data
	demonstrate that this technique is superior to localization based
	on Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the sum image under the assumption
	of point emitters. This technique has general application to any
	emitter with non-Gaussian temporal intensity distribution, including
	triplet state blinking. When applied to the labeling of structures,
	a high resolution "image" consisting of individually localized points
	may be reconstructed leading to the term "Pointillism".},

	fluorophores that are embedded in a mesostructured silica shell around
	individual gold nanorods is enhanced by the longitudinal plasmon
	resonance of the nanorods. Our electrostatic calculations show that
	under an off-resonance excitation, the electric field intensity contour
	around a nanorod rotates away from the length axis as the excitation
	polarization is varied. The polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced
	fluorescence is ascribed to the dependence of the averaged electric
	field intensity enhancement within the silica shell on the excitation
	polarization. The measured fluorescence enhancement factor is in
	very good agreement with that obtained from the electrostatic calculations.
	The fluorescence enhancement factor increases as the longitudinal
	plasmon wavelength is synthetically tuned close to the excitation
	wavelength. In addition, the polarization dependence is used to determine
	the orientation angle of the gold nanorods. The results are in excellent
	agreement with the actual measurements. Furthermore, the emission
	spectrum of the fluorophore is modified by the longitudinal plasmon
	resonance of the gold nanorods. A linear correlation between the

	adhesions on flexible substrates were irregularly shaped and highly
	dynamic whereas those on firm substrates had a normal morphology
	and were much more stable. Cells on flexible substrates also contained
	a reduced amount of phosphotyrosine at adhesion sites. Treatment
	of these cells with phenylarsine oxide, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor,
	induced the formation of normal, stable focal adhesions similar to
	those on firm substrates. Conversely, treatment of cells on firm
	substrates with myosin inhibitors 2,3-butanedione monoxime or KT5926
	caused the reduction of both vinculin and phosphotyrosine at adhesion
	sites. These results demonstrate the ability of cells to survey the
	mechanical properties of their surrounding environment and suggest
	the possible involvement of both protein tyrosine phosphorylation
	and myosin-generated cortical forces in this process. Such response
	to physical parameters likely represents an important mechanism of
	cellular interaction with the surrounding environment within a complex

  abstract = {The discovery of the extraordinary transmission phenomena has initiated
	an intense study of the interaction of light with subwavelength holes.
	In this thesis the dynamic and local properties of light interacting
	with subwavelength holes are investigated. First of all the role
	of hole shape on the propagation of femtosecond pulses through hole
	arrays and the nonlinear second harmonic generated is investigated.
	It is found that near the cutoff of a hole a maximum of pulse delay
	is found. Furthermore a larger delay leads to a larger amount of
	second harmonic. The local properties of light interacting with subwavelength
	holes are investigated with a new technique that employs the radiation
	that is generated when an electron travels trough the interface between
	two media with a different dielectric constant. This radiation- transition
	radiation- contains information on the optical environment. The high
	resolution of a focused beam of electrons leads thus to a ultra high
	resolution tool to obtain optical information. The technique is employed
	for the study of subwavelength holes, investigating the role of hole
	shape, the effects of polarization and the effects occurring in multiple

	imaging technique based on the localization of single molecules with

	(photo-activated localization microscopy) or STORM (stochastic optical
	reconstruction microscopy), these techniques achieve superresolution
	by allowing only a sparse, random set of molecules to emit light
	at any given time and subsequently localizing each molecule with
	great precision. Recently, such techniques have been extended to
	three dimensions, opening up unprecedented possibilities to explore
	the structure and function of cells. Interestingly, proper engineering
	of the three-dimensional (3D) point spread function (PSF) through
	additional optics has been demonstrated to theoretically improve
	3D position estimation and ultimately resolution. In this paper,
	an optimal 3D single-molecule localization estimator is presented
	in a general framework for noisy, aberrated and/or engineered PSF
	imaging. To find the position of each molecule, a phase-retrieval
	enabled maximum-likelihood estimator is implemented. This estimator
	is shown to be efficient, meaning it reaches the fundamental Cramer-Rao
	lower bound of x, y, and z localization precision. Experimental application
	of the phase-retrieval enabled maximum-likelihood estimator using
	a particular engineered PSF microscope demonstrates unmatched low-photon-count
	3D wide-field single-molecule localization performance.},

	as a new antioxidant system in solutions. A novel method for estimation
	of activity of the system was developed using a dissolved oxygen
	(DO) meter and an oxygen probe. The method can be used to determine
	the enzymatic activity of the system at GO concentrations of 0.005
	to 0.030 unit/ml, with an r2 of 0.995 for the linearity of the standard
	curve, and can be adapted for analysis in any solution. At room temperature
	of 23.0? ? 2.0?C, the maximum activity of the BDG-GO-CAT system was
	found to occur at pH 5.40. The half-life values for the stability
	of GO-CAT in 0.10 M phosphate buffer solutions of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,

	of GO-CAT was obtained using 20 mg/ml dextrose. The BDG-GO-CAT was
	effective as a DO scavenger in closed containers, when the containers
	were opened and exposed to atmosphere for 2 days between tests, and
	upon reclosing them. Pharmaceutical excipients such as ethanol, glycerin,
	propylene glycol, methylparaben, propylparaben, artificial strawberry

  abstract = {Abstract In the majority of implementations of light sheet microscopy,
	such as ultramicroscopy, the laser beam illuminating the specimen
	is truncated by a slit aperture before it is focused to a light sheet
	by a single cylindrical lens. A light sheet generated in this way
	can be made very thin near to the focal point, but unfortunately
	its Rayleigh range is severely limited. This problem can be partially
	solved by using a smaller slit aperture. However, this also causes
	a major loss in power, a severe broadening of the beam waist, and
	thus a significant loss of resolution along the detection axis. We
	developed improved light-sheet-generation optics, which provide longer
	Raleigh ranges, whilst retaining beam waists comparable to our standard
	system with one cylindrical lens. Using the modified system we achieved
	a marked improvement in the resolution of ultramicroscopy reconstructions
	of representative biological specimens. (\copyright 2010 WILEY-VCH

	all‐pervasive presence of noise is what makes deconvolution particularly
	difficult. The diversity of resulting algorithms reflects different
	ways of estimating the true signal under various idealizations of
	its properties. Different ways of approaching signal recovery are
	based on different instrumental noise models, whether the astronomical
	objects are pointlike or extended, and indeed on the computational
	resources available to the analyst. We present a number of recent
	results in this survey of signal restoration, including in the areas
	of superresolution and dithering. In particular, we show that most
	recent published work has consisted of incorporating some form of
	multiresolution in the deconvolution process.},

	Unlike for ensembles, by addressing a single emitter of well-defined

	multiple fluorescent subresolution tags with super-resolution in

	automatic detection of such tags in single frames and demonstrated
	its potential in a biological system. The algorithm presented here
	adds to the tag detector a module for relative tracking of the signals
	between frames. As with tag detection, the main problem in relative
	tracking arises when signals of multiple tags interfere. We propose
	a novel multitemplate matching framework that exploits knowledge
	of the microscope point spread function to separate the intensity
	contribution of each tag in image regions with signal interferences.
	We use this intensity splitting to reconstruct a template for each
	tag in the source frame and a patch in the target frame, which are
	both free of intensity contributions from other tag signals. Tag
	movements between frames are then tracked by seeking, for each template-patch
	pair, the displacement vector providing the best signal match in
	terms of the sum of squared intensity differences. Because template
	and patch generation of tags with overlapping signals are interdependent,
	the matching is carried out simultaneously for all tags, and in an
	iterative manner. We have examined the performance of our approach
	using synthetic 3D data and observed a significant increase in resolution
	and robustness as compared with our previously described detector.
	It is now possible to localize and track tags separated by a distance
	three times smaller than the Rayleigh limit with a relative positional

	images at a separation below the Rayleigh limit, i.e. with super-resolution.
	We demonstrate the potential of super-resolution detection by tracking
	fluorescently tagged chromosomes during mitosis in budding yeast.
	Our biological objective is to identify and analyse the proteins
	responsible for the generation of tensile force during chromosome
	segregation. Dynamic measurements in living cells are made possible
	by green fluroescent protein (GFP)-tagging chromosomes and spindle
	pole bodies to generate cells carrying four fluorescent spots, and
	observe the motion of the spots over time using 3D-fluorescence microscopy.
	The central problem in spot detection arises with the partial or
	complete overlap of spots when tagged objects are separated by distances
	below the resolution of the optics. To detect multiple spots under
	these conditions, a set of candidate mixture models is built, and
	the best candidate is selected from the set based on ?2-statistics
	of the residuals in least-square fits of the models to the image
	data.Even with images having a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low
	as 5-10, we are able to increase the resolution two-fold below the
	Rayleigh limit. In images with a SNR of 5-10, the accuracy with which
	isolated tags can be localized is less than 5 nm. For two tags separated
	by less than the Rayleigh limit, the localization accuracy is found
	to be between 10 and 20 nm, depending on the effective point-to-point
	distance. This indicates the intimate relationship between resolution
	and localization accuracy.},

	(3D) tracking of both fluorescent and nonfluorescent particles. We
	accomplish this by simultaneously imaging a focused plane, for in-plane
	position (x,y), and a defocused plane, for out-of-plane position
	(z), of a molecule using a single CCD camera. We applied our method
	to several systems including in vivo melanosome tracking and phagocytosed
	fluorescent bead tracking. We have achieved 2-5 nm accuracy with
	a 2-50 ms time resolution. },

  title = {Image Analysis Methods for Location Proteomics},

  abstract = {Proteins play a major role for the existence of all living organisms,
	since they are virtually involved in every kind of biological process.
	Unfortunately, the functions and interactions of the vast majority
	of proteins are unknown. The knowledge of these functions could provide
	crucial information for the simulation of cell behaviour, which facilitates
	the investigation of diseases as well as the development of innovative
	drugs and vaccines. There are several techniques dealing with this
	problem. One kind of very promising approaches is subsumed under
	the term location proteomics. It analyses the location of proteins
	in order to derive information about their function. As specific
	cell compartments fulfil specific tasks, a protein under consideration
	is likely to be involved in performing the function of the cell compartments
	it occurs in. But since the locations of proteins depend on the cell
	state and the environmental conditions, they are highly dynamic.
	Therefore, it is beneficial to examine them in living cells. This
	can be realised by means of fluorescence microscopy; the proteins
	in question are tagged by a fluorescent dye and subsequently rendered
	visible using a fluorescence microscope. Even co-localisations and
	temporary interactions of multiple proteins become observable. Therefore,
	location proteomics could reveal crucial details of cell processes.
	But even if tagged proteins can be observed in live cells, their
	analysis is difficult. A fluorescence image typically contains multiple
	or even numerous cells. These cells may be in various states resulting
	in different locations of the tagged proteins. Furthermore, the cells
	themselves are not necessarily visible. Hence, additional information
	is required. This thesis provides image analysis methods that facilitate
	the automatic localisation of proteins in living cells: Firstly,
	a procedure is introduced, which is able to recognise cells in bright-field
	microscope images. Here, the cells are automatically localised based
	on morphological operators and segmented by means of an enhanced
	active contour algorithm. The final segments are evaluated using
	an incremental neural network and support vector machines. This technique
	can be applied in conjunction with protein localisation approaches
	without causing any problems. Secondly, methods allowing the examination
	of protein distribution patterns within the recognised cells are
	discussed. Here, a set of appropriate features was selected, which
	enables a differentiation between ten protein locations. The classification
	is performed by an incremental neural network. So, additional protein
	location patterns and protein locations can be incorporated. Finally,
	both techniques were combined, which resulted in an automated system
	that is amenable to high-throughput processing. Such a system constitutes
	an innovative contribution to the current proteomic research, in
	particular, as incremental approaches are employed, which enable
	the integration of new information during their application.},

	the technique of temporal focusing it was shown that high axial resolution
	widefield excitation can be generated in picosecond time scales without
	any mechanical moving parts. However the achievable axial resolution
	is still well above that of a two-photon scanning microscope. Here
	we demonstrate a new ultrafast widefield two-photon imaging technique
	termed Multifocal Temporal Focusing (MUTEF) which relies on the generation
	of a set of diffraction limited beams produced by an Echelle grating
	that scan across a second tilted diffraction grating in picosecond
	time scale, generating a widefield excitation area with an axial
	resolution comparable to a two-photon scanning microscope. Using

	Adding or removing reductant or oxidant, switches the fluorescence
	of oxazine dyes between stable fluorescent and nonfluorescent states.
	At low oxygen concentrations, the off-state that we ascribe to a

	on the switching rate, between 400 and 3,000 switching cycles are
	observed before irreversible photodestruction occurs. A detailed
	picture of the underlying photoinduced and redox reactions is elaborated.
	In the presence of both reductant and oxidant, continuous switching
	is manifested by "blinking" with independently controllable on- and
	off-state lifetimes in both deoxygenated and oxygenated environments.
	This "continuous switching mode" is advantageously used for imaging

	whose shape is stabilized predominantly by the tensile stresses borne
	by filamentous structures. Accordingly, cell stiffness must increase
	in proportion with the level of the tensile stress, which is called
	the prestress. Here we have tested that prediction in adherent human
	airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells. Traction microscopy was used to
	measure the distribution of contractile stresses arising at the interface
	between each cell and its substrate; this distribution is called
	the traction field. Because the traction field must be balanced by
	tensile stresses within the cell body, the prestress could be computed.
	Cell stiffness (G) was measured by oscillatory magnetic twisting
	cytometry. As the contractile state of the cell was modulated with
	graded concentrations of relaxing or contracting agonists (isoproterenol
	or histamine, respectively), the mean prestress ((t)) ranged from
	350 to 1,900 Pa. Over that range, cell stiffness increased linearly
	with the prestress: G (Pa) = 0.18(t) + 92. While this association
	does not necessarily preclude other interpretations, it is the hallmark
	of systems that secure shape stability mainly through the prestress.
	Regardless of mechanism, these data establish a strong association
	between stiffness of HASM cells and the level of tensile stress within
	the cytoskeleton.},

	the photoinduced isomerization and back-isomerization, as well as
	the transitions between the singlet and triplet states of the dye.
	By employing a simple kinetic model, the rate constants of these

	of experimental conditions, where the influence on the isomerization
	properties of solvent viscosity, polarity, and temperature, excitation
	intensity and wavelength, and the presence of different side groups

	information about the rates of both the photoinduced isomerization

  abstract = {We prepared silver particle dimers with single Cy5 molecules localized
	between coupled metal particles. The silver particles with a 20 nm
	diameter were chemically bound with single-stranded oligonucleotides.
	The dimers were formed by hybridization with double-length single-stranded
	oligonucleotides that contained single Cy5 molecules. The image analysis
	revealed that the single-molecule fluorescence was enhanced 7-fold
	on the metal monomer and 13-fold on the metal dimer relative to the
	free Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide in the absence of metal. The lifetimes
	were shortened on the silver monomers and further shortened on the
	silver dimers, demonstrating the near-field interaction mechanism
	of fluorophore with the metal substrate. Finite-difference time-domain
	(FDTD) calculations were employed to study the distribution of electric
	field near the metal monomer and dimer. The coupling effect of metal
	particle on the fluorescence enhancement was discussed. },

  journal = nat-nanotechnol,

  volume = {7},
  pages = {237--241},
  abstract = {Metal nanoparticles are used as catalysts in a variety of important
	chemical reactions1, 2, and can have a range of different shapes3,
	4, 5, 6, 7, 8, with facets and sites that differ in catalytic reactivity1,
	2, 9. To develop better catalysts it is necessary to determine where
	catalysis occurs on such nanoparticles and what structures are more
	reactive. Surface science experiments or theory can be used to predict
	the reactivity of surfaces with a known structure1, 2, 10, and the
	reactivity of nanocatalysts can often be rationalized from a knowledge
	of their well-defined surface facets3, 4, 5. Here, we show that a
	knowledge of the surface facets of a gold nanorod catalyst is insufficient
	to predict its reactivity, and we must also consider defects on the
	surface of the nanorod. We use super-resolution fluorescence microscopy
	to quantify the catalysis of the nanorods at a temporal resolution
	of a single catalytic reaction and a spatial resolution of ~40 nm.
	We find that within the same surface facets on the sides of a single
	nanorod, the reactivity is not constant and exhibits a gradient from
	the centre of the nanorod towards its two ends. Furthermore, the
	ratio of the reactivity at the ends of the nanorod to the reactivity
	at the sides varies significantly from nanorod to nanorod, even though
	they all have the same surface facets.},

  journal = new-j-phys,

  abstract = {Nano-antennae consisting of gold particle dimers were fabricated by
	electron-beam lithography. Dark-field scattering spectroscopy was
	used to probe the plasmonic response of individual nano-antennae
	and to characterize the localized surface plasmon resonances they
	support. Fluorescence from dye molecules dispersed in a thin polymer
	film that covered the dimers was used to probe the interaction between
	fluorophores and the nano-antennae. Through a suitable choice of
	dye emission spectrum and spectral position of the dimer resonance,
	we were able to focus on the way the plasmon resonances may mediate
	absorption of incident light by the dye. We separated out the role
	of plasmon resonances on absorption from emission. This was done
	using energy transfer in a donor?acceptor pair of dyes.},
