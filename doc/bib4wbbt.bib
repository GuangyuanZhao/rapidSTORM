  abstract = {Calculation of the centroid of the images of individual fluorescent
	particles and molecules allows localization and tracking in light
	microscopes to a precision about an order of magnitude greater than
	the microscope resolution. The factors that limit the precision of
	these techniques are examined and a simple equation derived that
	describes the precision of localization over a wide range of conditions.
	In addition, a localization algorithm motivated from least-squares
	fitting theory is constructed and tested both on image stacks of
	30-nm fluorescent beads and on computer-generated images (Monte Carlo
	simulations). Results from the algorithm show good agreement with
	the derived precision equation for both the simulations and actual
	images. The availability of a simple equation to describe localization
	precision helps investigators both in assessing the quality of an
	experimental apparatus and in directing attention to the factors
	that limit further improvement. The precision of localization scales
	as the inverse square root of the number of photons in the spot for
	the shot noise limited case and as the inverse of the number of photons
	for the background noise limited case. The optimal image magnification
	depends on the expected number of photons and background noise, but,
	for most cases of interest, the pixel size should be about equal
	to the standard deviation of the point spread function.},

  title = {Three-Dimensional Super-Resolution Imaging by Stochastic Optical
	Reconstruction Microscopy},
  journal = sci,

  volume = {319},
  pages = {810--813},
  number = {5864},
  month = {February},
  abstract = {Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial
	improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution
	of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional
	(3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge.
	We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)
	by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral
	positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative,
	stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision
	3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D
	image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved
	an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions
	and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development
	allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.

	the structure of NPCs has been studied extensively during the last
	few decades, mainly by electron microscopy. We have used super-resolution
	imaging by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM)
	to investigate the structure of NPCs in isolated Xenopus laevis oocyte
	nuclear envelopes, with a lateral resolution of ~15 nm. By generating
	accumulated super-resolved images of hundreds of NPCs we determined
	the diameter of the central NPC channel to be 41+-7 nm and demonstrate
	that the integral membrane protein gp210 is distributed in an eightfold
	radial symmetry. Two-color dSTORM experiments emphasize the highly
	symmetric NPCs as ideal model structures to control the quality of
	corrections to chromatic aberration and to test the capability and
	reliability of super-resolution imaging methods.},
