      <title>dSTORM engine</title>
         <para>The dSTORM engine is the collective term for the core of the
         rapidSTORM software that is not part of the input or output
         drivers. The dSTORM engine is responsible for converting a
         vector of input images into a set of <xref 
         linkend="localization"/>s, performing
         the steps of spot detection, spot fitting and spot judging
         defined in <xref linkend="WolterDiplomarbeit"/>. While the exact
         algorithms are out of the scope of this manual, a short summary
         of the engine operation can be given:</para>
         <para>First, the input images are smoothed to reduce the amount of
         noise present. The local maximums of these noise-reduced images
         are located and stored as spot candidates, that is, positions
         where spot positions are likely to be present. The candidates
         are sorted with the strongest values first in the list and then
         nonlinearly fitted with the <xref linkend="psf_model"/> in the
         order established by that sorting. Once three
         successive candidates have failed to be fitted as localizations,
         the fitting process for the image is aborted.</para>

   <section id="localization" xreflabel="localization">
      <title>Localization</title>
         <para>A localization denotes the position (space and time) and the
         strength of a 
         suspected fluorophore emission. A localization denotes only a 
         suspected
         position because the high noise conditions in photoswitching
         micrsocopy introduce false localizations, either through background
         noise or multiple close-by emitters.</para>
         <para>Localization coordinates are not given on a lattice as pixels
         are, but are rather subpixel-accurate. The accuracy is mostly
         given by the emission strength and the background noise as 
         described by <xref linkend="Thompson2002"/>.</para>

         <title>3D fitting</title>
         <para>rapidSTORM can fit both astigmatic and biplane 3D data by
         introducing an explicit Z parameter into the point spread function.
         It is assumed that the 2D Gaussian model describes the PSF and that
         the widths of the PSF in X and Y direction are functions of the 
         emitter's Z coordinate. Two different models are supported for this
         function, a set of piecewise cubic functions or a single quartic function (polynomial model).</para>

      <title>Z calibration file</title>
         <para>A Z calibration file is a plain text file with three whitespace-separated columns.
            The first column gives an emitter's Z coordinate in nanometres, and the second and third columns
            give the standard deviation of a Gaussian describing the PSF for an emitter at the given
            Z coordinate. They describe the X and Y dimension of the camera, respectively, and are
            given in micrometers.</para>
         <para>The range of the Z calibration file (lowest and highest Z coordinate) gives the working
            depth of the approximation.</para>

   <section id="polynomial_3d">
      <title>Polynomial model</title>
         <para>rapidSTORM can fit both astigmatic and biplane 3D data by
            introducing an explicit Z parameter into the point spread function.
            The Z parameter modifies the width parameters of the PSF according
            to <xref linkend="eq:polynomial_3d"/>. In other terms, we model the
            variance of the PSF in the lateral directions 
            (<inlineequation><mathphrase>&sgr;<subscript>x</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation>)
            as a polynom of the
            axial offset from the best-focused plane. The necessary parameters
            are the axial positions of the best-focused planes
            (<inlineequation><mathphrase>z<subscript>x</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation> and
            <inlineequation><mathphrase>z<subscript>y</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation>),
            the standard deviation of the PSF in the best-focused plane
            (<inlineequation><mathphrase>&sgr;<subscript>0,x</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation> and
            <inlineequation><mathphrase>&sgr;<subscript>0,y</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation>) and
            the effective focus depths for the polynomial terms
            (<inlineequation><mathphrase>&Dgr;&sgr;<subscript>i,x</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation> and
            <inlineequation><mathphrase>&Dgr;&sgr;<subscript>i,y</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation>).
            The point spread function model has been adapted from <xref linkend="Huang2008"/> and
            expanded with the natural linear term. However, rapidSTORM improves upon
            it by fitting the Z coordinate directly instead of using the complicated
            variance-space distance determination presented in the paper.

            These parameters are normally determined externally from

            <inlineequation><mathphrase>z<subscript>y</subscript></mathphrase></inlineequation> are 
            set to different values. While the distance between the planes is crucially important for
            3D localization, the absolute values and relative sign of the best-focused
            plane coordinates determine the direction and offset of the Z axis in the
            results. For biplane imaging,

            Traditionally, rapidSTORM supported two PSF models called "Parabolic 3D" and 
            "Holtzer 3D". Both of these models are subsets of to the polynomial model,
            and their parameters can be converted. For the Holtzer model, only the second
            derivative needs to be given as <inlineequation><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata

            denotes the Holtzer widening constant. For the parabolic model, the second and
            fourth derivatives must be given as

   <section id="repeater" xreflabel="Repeater">
      <title>Repeater</title>
         <para>A repeater is any output module that stores all received
            <xref linkend="localization"/>s in memory and can repeat them if
            necessary. While
            this costs, naturally, roughly 32 bytes of memory per localization,
            it allows changing many processing parameters even after 
            computation has started.</para>
         <para>However, repeaters are not able to store the input images used
            in computation because doing so would quickly exhaust the available
            memory. Therefore, output modules that need access to source images
            may not be used as children of repeater modules.</para>
   </section>

   <section id="psf_model" xreflabel="PSF model">
      <title>PSF model</title>
         <para>The point spread function (PSF) is modeled for rapidSTORM
            purposes as a two-dimensional Gaussian function added to a
            background signal. This function has the parameters amplitude,
            background signal, center position and 
            covariance matrix. We can assume the covariance matrix to be
            constant for any acquisition, and so only the amplitude, the
            background signal and the center position are fitted by the engine,
            while the covariance matrix is estimated iteratively by a second
            fitting process or given a-priori.
         </para>
         <para>While this Gaussian model does not match the point spread 
            functions of real systems exactly, it is a good approximation
            with easily computed derivatives. Studies such as Thomann et al.
            have shown that the
            approximation is good enough for practical purposes.

   <section id="two_kernel_analysis">
      <title>Two-kernel analysis</title>
         <para>When (FOO)
            indicated a likely double emission, this hypothesis is tested by
            fitting a model consisting of the sum of two Gaussian functions
            with a common background to the data. This is called two-kernel
            analysis. When two-kernel analysis produces a two-kernel fit with
            two nonnegligible kernels and with significantly smaller residues
            than the normal one-kernel fit, the hypothesis of a double emission
            is deemed confirmed.</para>

   <section id="linear_drift_correction"
            xreflabel="linear drift correction">
      <title>Linear drift correction</title>
         <para>Instabilities in the experimental setup can, despite all
            experimental effort, lead to a slow, creeping shift (called drift)
            of the 
            specimen's image on the camera detector. In this case, the quality
            of the resulting image is greatly degraded because structures
            appear smeared in the direction of the drift.</para>
         <para>In most cases, the drift is small and approximately linear
            over the course of the acquisition. Such a drift can be corrected
            by substracting the drift velocity times the time elapsed since
            acquisition start from each image.</para>
         <para>A convenient way to fine-tune drift correction is to add
            a time-hued image display as a child of the localization filter and
            optimize the settings for a mostly white or, at least, largely
            color-uncorrelated image.</para>
