Abstract
---------

The configuration of parameters in simulation software is an often overlooked
aspect of the development process.  SimParm is a C++ framework that alleviates
the burden of managing configuration parameters from software developers.  It
has been designed to be simple, easy to use and flexible, both when defining
parameters and using them in the simulation.  Plain text configuration files
are supported, as well as overriding values on the command line.  SimParm
allows interactive real-time adjustment of parameters during the simulation -
when running locally and remotely.  Furthermore, multiple users can adjust
parameters, allowing collaborative exploration of the parameter space.  This
helps users to determine suitable parameter values for unfamiliar datasets -
even when the dataset is too large to run be run on the local workstation.
This paper describes the design and usage of SimParm, and includes an example
application of a simple mass-spring simulation of a triangular mesh.


Requirements
-------------

1. C++ compiler for libsimparm
2. Python v1.5 or higher for multiplexor
3. Java2 1.5 or higher SDK (to compile) or JRE (to run) for twiddler
4. GNU make
5. A POSIX compliant system is probably a requirement.
   At least, you need pthread.


Compilation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Edit the top-level Makefile, set installation directories and choose
   compiler and/or compiler options.

2. Run 'make' (or 'gmake').

3. Run 'make install' to install into the directories specified in the
   top-level Makefile.

4. Run 'make clean' to clean the object files.


Usage Instructions
-------------------

To use SimParm, please refer to the example programs located in the examples/
subdirectory, and to the paper

    configuration framework for interactive and batch simulation
    software", ISC07

More detailed usage documentation will be available in future releases of
SimParm.
